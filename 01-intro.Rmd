## Training Description 
Livestock are key to food security, nutrition and livelihoods. The demand for livestock products is expected to double in developing countries. However, the livestock sector is also associated with great environmental costs such as land degradation, high water use, excessive GHG emissions and loss of natural ecosystems and biodiversity. 
Designing sustainable livestock enterprises poses a challenge in developing countries due to lack of data and models. The CLEANED minimum data ex-ante environmental impact tool developed by the Alliance can help to fill this gap. CLEANED is an easy-to-use Excel-based tool that allows users to explore multiple impacts of developing livestock production systems. It models the impacts of changes in different livestock enterprises on productivity, land and water use, greenhouse gas emissions and soil health. 

The aim for this training is to strengthen the technical capacity of agriculture stakeholders and for them to be able to use this tool as a means of improved decision making in the agriculture development sector with a focus on livestock systems. 

## Learning Outcomes 
If I've done a good job as the instructor and you've put effort into the training, by the end of the two weeks, you will be able to:

1. **Describe** the importance of carrying out environmental impacts assessments in the livestock sector.
2. **Carry out** CLEANED assessments in your day to day activities and be able to:
     + **Calculate** and gather valid input data needed for the model
     + **Explain** the calculations and parametrize the tool for a specific enterprise in a specific region
     + **Carry out** different intervention scenarios
3. **Summarize**, **analysis** outputs needed for decision making.

## Expectations
